- Community Platforms (For forums, social networks, knowledge sharing, e.g., print farm communities, specific 3D printer user groups)
- Data Dashboards (For monitoring, visualizing data, e.g., printer telemetry, production metrics, sensor readings)
- Interactive Tools (Web-based configurators, design tools, slicer interfaces, model viewers)
- APIs & Integrations (Connecting different software and services, enabling automated workflows between design, slicing, and printing)
- Cloud Computing (For scalable processing, storage, simulation, rendering)
- Learning & Documentation (Online courses, tutorials, extensive documentation for machines or software)
- Supply Chain Management (Ordering materials, tracking shipments, managing inventory for print farms)
