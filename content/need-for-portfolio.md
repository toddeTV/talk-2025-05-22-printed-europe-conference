# What do I need for my Portfolio?

- Domain
- Server
  - Self-Hosted
    - Service-Oriented
    - (v)Root
  - Cloud (e.g. Cloudflare, GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- CMS for changing data with an editor like approach: both static & dynamic data
  - headless CMS vs TODO
- Program yourself: Do not code anymore in plain HTML or PHP, use Metaframeworks
- Integrations: e.g. outsource your search, add a shop, etc.

Think about the structure:

Long living Data vs Short Living Data
Your Data at Build vs Data in Production

Also think about:
What data can be shipped to the client and what not?
